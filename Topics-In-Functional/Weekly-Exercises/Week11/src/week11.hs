{-
    Build a simple desktop calculator using ThreePenny GUI.
    It should handle four-function arithmetic (add, subtract, 
    divide, multiply) and display at least 8-bit integers. 
    Include a Clear button to reset the calculator. You don't 
    have to implement anything fancy, you can implement the 
    actual calculation any way you want (including just "read"-
    ing strings that are built up in the UI, or reusing the 
    simple expression evaluator we saw in class).
